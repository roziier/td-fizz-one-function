# FizzBuzz

### Step 1

Write a program that returns array of numbers from 1 to 100, while multiples of three return "Fizz" instead of the number, multiples of five return "Buzz". Multiples of both three and five return "FizzBuzz".

### Step 2

##### Add a way to change range, instead of printing numbers from 1 to 100. Examples: numbers from 1 to 20, from 15 to 50.

### Step 3

##### Add rules for 7 and 11: 7 returns "Foo", 11 returns "Boo" and multiples of both return "FooBoo".

### Step 4

##### Add new rule for numbers smaller than 16 which return "Small" and a rule for numbers bigger than 95 which return "Big".

### Step 5

##### Add ability to change rules for initial requirement, instead of "Fizz" (multiples of 3) return "Buzz", and instead of "Buzz" (multiples of 5) return "Fizz"

### Step 6

##### Add new rule for "multiples of 3 and 5" return "FTW", and for "multiples of 3 or 5" return "GG"
